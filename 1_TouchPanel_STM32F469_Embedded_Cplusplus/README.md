# TouchPanel_STM32F469_Embedded_Cplusplus

Part 1 of 4 of my MSc Thesis project. This directory contains software of touch panel implemented on STM32F469 board used to monitor and control parameters of power converter by communicating with power converter driver.

GUI part has been generated using TouchGFX framework and it utilizes FreeRTOS to maintain proper GUI responsiveness.

The code of the driver implemented on STM32 Nucleo-F411 is available in directory 2_PowerConverterDriver_STM32NucleoF411_Embedded_Cplusplus

# How to run

Flash STM32F469 Discovery board using file flash/application.hex
