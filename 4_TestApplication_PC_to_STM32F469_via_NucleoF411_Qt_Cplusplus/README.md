# TestApplication_PC_directly_to_STM32F469_Qt_Cplusplus

Part 4 of 4 of my M.Sc. Thesis project. This directory contains Qt5 application used to test UART communication between touch panel (**STM32F469 Discovery**) and power converter driver (**STM32F411-RE Nucleo**) by sending UART commands to Nucleo board which triggers communication between the two boards.

**parameters.xml** files contain example initialization data for modules controlled by touch panel.

Code for the touch panel (**STM32F469 Discovery**) is available in directory **1_TouchPanel_STM32F469_Embedded_Cplusplus**

Code for the power converter driver (**STM32 F411-Nucleo**) is available in directory **2_PowerConverterDriver_STM32NucleoF411_Embedded_Cplusplus**
