# PowerConverterDriver_STM32NucleoF411_Embedded_Cplusplus

Part 2 of 4 of my MSc Thesis project. This directory contains software of power converter driver implemented on STM32F411-Nucleo board used to monitor and control parameters of power converter. This application communicates directly with the touch panel implemented on STM32F469.

The code for the touch panel is available in directory 1_TouchPanel_STM32F469_Embedded_Cplusplus

# How to run

Flash STM32 Nucleo-F411 board using file flash/PowerConverterDriver_NucleoF411.elf
